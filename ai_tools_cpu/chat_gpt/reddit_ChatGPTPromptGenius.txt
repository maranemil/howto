30 ChatGPT Prompt Techniques in 30 Seconds.
#####################################################

https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1hcsmem/30_chatgpt_prompt_techniques_in_30_seconds/


Well articulated prompts are the secret sauce to getting exactly what you need from your chatbot, but with
so many options, it’s easy to get lost. So I collected 30 ChatGPT techniques for you!

Here’s a dense yet digestible rundown of how to tweak your prompts for better, faster, and smarter responses—all in record time.

Why Prompts Matter
Think of prompts as a way to shape information , or in simple terms, perfect questions.

The better you define the task, the closer the AI sticks to your expectations.

Whether you’re looking for detailed research, creative storytelling, or quick solutions, the prompt sets the tone.
 A little upfront thought goes a long way.

The Art of Precision

Be Specific: Vague prompts lead to vague answers. Instead of “Tell me about marketing,” say, “What are the top digital marketing trends of 2024?”

Assign Roles: Framing the AI as a teacher, marketer, or friend changes its response style instantly.

Set Limits: Ask for answers in specific lengths or formats. Want 3 bullet points or a 100-word summary? Say so.

Crafting for Control

Tone Modulation: Want a serious tone? Say it. Need something casual? Specify it. The AI adapts.

Questions with Layers: Instead of one broad question, layer prompts.
 Start with a big idea and then drill down into details.

Hypotheticals Work: Use “what if” scenarios to spark problem-solving.

Iterate, Don’t Stagnate
Prompts aren’t one-and-done. After your first attempt, tweak based on the AI’s response.

Spending just a few extra seconds refining your approach can yield transformative results.

Here are 30 Prompts To Use,
------------------------------------------
Open-ended prompts are powerful for unlocking detailed, thought-provoking responses.
These questions encourage the respondent to explore their thoughts, ideas, and reasoning without
restrictive boundaries. They also excel at generating actionable insights when precision isn’t the goal.
 These prompts shine when the aim is discovery rather than definitive answers.

Why Prompts

Section 2: Closed-Ended Prompts
------------------------------------------
Closed-Ended Prompts seek specific, concise answers, often requiring a "yes" or "no" response or selecting from limited options.

Yes-No Prompts
Example: "Is Python a suitable language for web development?"

Either-Or Prompts
Example: "Would you recommend TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning projects?"

Multiple Choice Prompts

Section 3: Probing Prompts
------------------------------------------
Probing Prompts delve deeper into responses to uncover more detail or explore underlying issues, enhancing the depth of the conversation with the language model.

Deep Dive Prompts
Example: "Can you provide more details on how neural networks function?"

Follow-Up Prompts
Example: "You mentioned data augmentation; can you elaborate on its techniques?"

Clarifying Probes
Example: "What exactly do you mean by 'scalable architecture'?"

 7 tips for writing better AI prompts (that actually get results):
############################################

1. Give context.
Don’t start with “Write me an email.”
Start with:
 “You're an email copywriter writing to busy CTOs about a productivity tool.”
The model mirrors your setup.

2. Be specific about the outcome.
Vague prompts = vague results.
Bad:
 “Help me get organized.”
Better:
 “Create a weekly Notion layout that balances deep work, meetings, and gym.”

3. Add constraints.
Want sharper output? Add rules.
Examples:
• "Use 12 words max per sentence."
• "Avoid buzzwords."
• "Make it sound like Alex Hormozi."
Less freedom = more precision.

4. Show examples.
You can teach the model with samples.
Add: “Here’s an example I like…”
 “Write in this style…”
It learns your taste fast.

5. Use role-based instructions.
This one’s powerful.
Say:
 “You are a Harvard admissions officer.”
 Or:
 “You are a productivity coach for CEOs.”
It thinks like that person.

6. Stack prompts instead of cramming one.
Break big tasks into steps:
• Step 1: Create outline
• Step 2: Expand ideas
• Step 3: Format for X
Each step = better results.

7. Test, tweak, repeat.
Prompts are like recipes.
You won’t get it perfect on the first try.
Tweak the instructions. Rerun. Compare.
 That’s how pros work.

Podcasts offer a rich medium for storytelling and information sharing. Here are five
unconventional ways an entrepreneur could harness ChatGPT prompts to enhance their podcast episodes:🎙️

1. **Futuristic Radio Plays**: Use ChatGPT to script a short radio drama set in the future of the entrepreneur's industry.
Periodically introduce these mini-plays as special segments, combining entertainment with speculative insights.

2. **AI Interviewee**: Have an episode where ChatGPT plays the role of the guest, discussing topics ranging from AI's perspective
 on human innovations to future predictions. This would not only be informative but could also present a fun, unique angle to
 standard interview formats.

3. **Historical Connections**: Request ChatGPT to relate the podcast's theme to historical events or figures.
Create episodes that interweave current industry topics with historical narratives, providing context and drawing unexpected parallels.

4. **Interactive Listeners' Corner**: Encourage listeners to send in questions or topics they'd like to be explored.
Use ChatGPT to generate comprehensive answers or discussions and dedicate a segment to address these queries in-depth.

5. **Story Expansion**: If the entrepreneur narrates real-life experiences or case studies, they could provide a brief to ChatGPT
and ask for fictional expansions. The AI might weave tales of "what could've happened," adding
a layer of intrigue and exploration to real events.

By integrating ChatGPT into podcast creation in these inventive ways, entrepreneurs can produce episodes
that captivate, educate, and entertain their audience in fresh and unexpected manners.
