# # Image Classification
# In this project, you'll classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).  The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded.  You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.  At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.
# ## Get the Data

# ## Explore the Data
# The dataset is broken into batches to prevent your machine from running out of memory.  The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 5 batches, named `data_batch_1`, `data_batch_2`, etc.. Each batch contains the labels and images that are one of the following:
# * airplane
# * automobile
# * bird
# * cat
# * deer
# * dog
# * frog
# * horse
# * ship
# * truck
# 
# Understanding a dataset is part of making predictions on the data.  Play around with the code cell below by changing the `batch_id` and `sample_id`. The `batch_id` is the id for a batch (1-5). The `sample_id` is the id for a image and label pair in the batch.
# 
# Ask yourself "What are all possible labels?", "What is the range of values for the image data?", "Are the labels in order or random?".  Answers to questions like these will help you preprocess the data and end up with better predictions.

# ## Build the network
# For the neural network, you'll build each layer into a function.  Most of the code you've seen has been outside of functions. To test your code more thoroughly, we require that you put each layer in a function.  This allows us to give you better feedback and test for simple mistakes using our unittests before you submit your project.
# 
# >**Note:** If you're finding it hard to dedicate enough time for this course each week, we've provided a small shortcut to this part of the project. In the next couple of problems, you'll have the option to use classes from the [TensorFlow Layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers) or [TensorFlow Layers (contrib)](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/contrib.layers) packages to build each layer, except the layers you build in the "Convolutional and Max Pooling Layer" section.  TF Layers is similar to Keras's and TFLearn's abstraction to layers, so it's easy to pickup.
# 
# >However, if you would like to get the most out of this course, try to solve all the problems _without_ using anything from the TF Layers packages. You **can** still use classes from other packages that happen to have the same name as ones you find in TF Layers! For example, instead of using the TF Layers version of the `conv2d` class, [tf.layers.conv2d](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/conv2d), you would want to use the TF Neural Network version of `conv2d`, [tf.nn.conv2d](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv2d). 
# 
# Let's begin!
# 
# ### Input
# The neural network needs to read the image data, one-hot encoded labels, and dropout keep probability. Implement the following functions
# * Implement `neural_net_image_input`
#  * Return a [TF Placeholder](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder)
#  * Set the shape using `image_shape` with batch size set to `None`.
#  * Name the TensorFlow placeholder "x" using the TensorFlow `name` parameter in the [TF Placeholder](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder).
# * Implement `neural_net_label_input`
#  * Return a [TF Placeholder](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder)
#  * Set the shape using `n_classes` with batch size set to `None`.
#  * Name the TensorFlow placeholder "y" using the TensorFlow `name` parameter in the [TF Placeholder](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder).
# * Implement `neural_net_keep_prob_input`
#  * Return a [TF Placeholder](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder) for dropout keep probability.
#  * Name the TensorFlow placeholder "keep_prob" using the TensorFlow `name` parameter in the [TF Placeholder](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder).
# 
# These names will be used at the end of the project to load your saved model.
# 
# Note: `None` for shapes in TensorFlow allow for a dynamic size.

# ### Convolution and Max Pooling Layer
# Convolution layers have a lot of success with images. For this code cell, you should implement the function `conv2d_maxpool` to apply convolution then max pooling:
# * Create the weight and bias using `conv_ksize`, `conv_num_outputs` and the shape of `x_tensor`.
# * Apply a convolution to `x_tensor` using weight and `conv_strides`.
#  * We recommend you use same padding, but you're welcome to use any padding.
# * Add bias
# * Add a nonlinear activation to the convolution.
# * Apply Max Pooling using `pool_ksize` and `pool_strides`.
#  * We recommend you use same padding, but you're welcome to use any padding.
# 
# **Note:** You **can't** use [TensorFlow Layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers) or [TensorFlow Layers (contrib)](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/contrib.layers) for **this** layer, but you can still use TensorFlow's [Neural Network](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn) package.

# ## Why 50-80% Accuracy?
# You might be wondering why you can't get an accuracy any higher. First things first, 50% isn't bad for a simple CNN.  Pure guessing would get you 10% accuracy. That's because there are many more techniques that can be applied to your model and we recemmond that once you are done with this project, you explore!
