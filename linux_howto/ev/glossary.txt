OCPI
#########################################################
OCPI-enabled facilities allow for automatic “roaming,” where drivers plug into various EV charging networks seamlessly and without hassle. OCPI allows you to use a wide variety of EV charging networks without having to have separate accounts or other troublesome means of verification with each of them.

Provides other benefits as well, like billing, tariff information, charge point status and platform monitoring. But the roaming ability is most important, as it prevents users from being beholden to a single charging network.

OCPI allow drivers to compile their bills from different stations, instead of having to keep track of each individual one.


#########################################################
OCPI *
#########################################################
Not to be confused with the EV charger communication protocol OCPP, OCPI stands for Open Charge Point Interface.
OCPI allows for automated roaming between various EV charging networks.

Charge Point Operator (CPO):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CPOs connect and operate smart EV chargers. They provide the technology needed to interact with EV chargers. This includes everything from a simple "start charge" request to complicated demand-response commands from the grid.

#########################################################
e-Mobility Service Provider (EMSP, eMSP, or EMP): *
#########################################################

EMSPs provide end-user access to EV chargers. This sounds very similar to a CPO — and many CPOs are also EMSPs — but not always. In North America, EVgo and Electrify America are two of the largest EMSPs, but they are not CPOs themselves — they hire other companies to provide the technology needed to operate their networks of EV chargers.

#########################################################
Distribution System Operator (DSO): *
#########################################################

Unlike CPOs and EMSPs, DSOs are not in the EV charging business by definition — but they may choose to be. DSOs are responsible operating (and sometimes owning) energy distribution networks. Depending on your province or state, your local DSO could be an electric utility, a local distribution company (LDC), or an independent system operator (ISO).

#########################################################
Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) *
#########################################################

OCPI is one of these communication protocols and the focus of this article. It’s managed by the EV Roaming Foundation, which ensures that it remains free, and has a great greatest impact on the consumer. See, OCPI manages communication between charge station operators and the eMobility service providers that give drivers access to charging stations. The result is that OCPI-enabled facilities allow for automatic “roaming,” where drivers plug into various EV charging networks seamlessly and without hassle. Think of it a bit like having a debit card versus hard cash that can only be used in one country.

OCPI allows you to use a wide variety of EV charging networks without having to have separate accounts or other troublesome means of verification with each of them. It ensures that you can use them without a problem, allowing EV drivers to “roam” from place to place with little issue. It provides other benefits as well, like billing, tariff information, charge point status and platform monitoring. But the roaming ability is most important, as it prevents users from being beholden to a single charging network.

Billing and Tariffs
The communications provided by OCPI allow drivers to compile their bills from different stations, instead of having to keep track of each individual one. The time saved by bringing them all into one place can represent quite the financial windfall. Likewise, calculating energy tariffs when crossing national and state lines can be incredibly complex. OCPI procedures handle that for you, making it a non-issue.

Between these two benefits, calculations and accounting that could represent irksome investments for businesses are handled automatically, with little difficulty.

#########################################################
Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) *
#########################################################

The Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) is an application protocol for communication between Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and a central management system, also known as a charging station network, similar to cell phones and cell phone networks. The original version was written by Joury de Reuver and Franc Buve.[1]
The latest version is version 2.0. (OCPP versions)

The protocol is an initiative of the ELaadNL foundation[2] in the Netherlands. Its aim was to create an open application protocol which allows EV charging stations and central management systems from different vendors to communicate with each other. It is in use by a large number of vendors of EV charging stations and central management systems all over the world.[3]

#########################################################
Electrical Vehicle Charge Point Operator (EV CPO) *
#########################################################

An EV Charge Point Operator (CPO) manages electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
An Electrical Vehicle Charge Point Operator (EV CPO) is a company or organization that owns, operates, and manages electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. This includes public and private charging stations and the hardware and software systems needed to manage them.

An EV CPO typically offers a range of charging options to meet the needs of different types of electric vehicles and drivers. These options may include different levels of charging speed, payment methods, and access controls.
An EV CPO also plays a key role in developing and expanding EV charging infrastructure. This includes identifying and securing locations for new charging stations, negotiating contracts with property owners and other stakeholders, and implementing the necessary infrastructure and systems to support EV charging.
In addition to operating charging stations, EV CPOs may also offer additional services such as maintenance and repair, customer support, and billing and payment processing.

The EV Charge Point Operator typically uses charging management software (CMS) to monitor and manage their charging stations remotely. This software can track charging sessions, manage user accounts, accept and process payments from EV drivers, and generate reports. The more advances CMS provides energy usage optimization to help balance the load on the grid and reduce energy costs.
Overall, the role of EV CPOs is to ensure that electric vehicle drivers have access to reliable, convenient, and cost-effective charging options and to help facilitate the transition to a cleaner and more sustainable transportation system.

#########################################################
Charge Point Operator (CPO)
#########################################################
Charge Point Operator (CPO) is an eMobility industry player, that builds EV charging sites, installs hardware from a variety of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) vendors, and ensures optimal ongoing EV charging operations. CPOs provide the charging network infrastructure, managing the backend technologies as well as the communications between the backend system and the chargers, to deliver reliable and consistent EV charging. CPO customers are eMobility service providers (EMSPs), who own and manage the business relationships with electric vehicles drivers.
Charge point operators optimize operations of the EV charging infrastructure for the eMobility ecosystem. They need to ensure maximum chargers’ uptime today, and be futureproof for tomorrow, with the capacity and scalability to manage the exponential growth of EV charging.
CPOs need to guarantee that EV chargers are always available and stable, operating 24/7 without fail. Systems need to be in place to notify them any time a problem arises with the chargers – or automatically fix it where possible, reducing operating costs and minimizing impact on EV drivers.
All CPO software platforms need to deliver real-time information necessary to optimize operations, analyzing business and technical data for efficient decision-making. Automation is key to reducing TCO. Process automation tools need to seamlessly handle transactional and technical issues without requiring employee intervention.
Furthermore, smart energy management helps reduce capital and operating costs by better managing energy demand during peak hours, and integrating renewables and local battery storage.

#########################################################
e-Mobility Service Provider
 #########################################################
An e-mobility service provider is a company offering an EV charging service to EV drivers. An EMSP creates value for its customers (EV drivers) by providing access to multiple charging points around a geographic area.
A Charge Point Operator (CPO) is a company operating a pool of charging points. A CPO creates value by providing smart charging features to EMSPs.
Charge Point Operators vs Charge Point Owners
EV charging is full of abbreviations, and some might be confusing. For instance, Charge Point Operators and Charge Point Owners are commonly referred to as CPOs, even though their roles aren’t entirely similar.
A charge point owner … owns a charging infrastructure.
A charge point operator … provides the owner with the connection to an EMSP. Of course, in some cases, an operator can also be the owner of charging infrastructures, and vice versa.

#########################################################
Charge point operator (CPO)
#########################################################
A charge point operator installs and maintains charge stations so drivers can charge their electric vehicles. CPOs can either own and operate a set of charge stations, or simply operate them for third parties.
The tasks of a charge point operator can be broken down into two categories:
Operational – purchasing charge stations, installing hardware and maintaining the network connection.
Commercial – setting prices for charging infrastructure use and managing the connection to e-mobility service providers.

#########################################################
CPOs, Charge Point Owners, and EMSPs explained
#########################################################
CPO: Manages the procurement, installation, operation, and maintenance of the individual charging units, or ‘charge points.’
EMSP: Connects customers to a wide pool of charge points operated by a range of CPOs, and facilitates easy payment via a user-friendly subscription service and/or smartphone app.
Charge Point Owner: Finances and oversees the new charging infrastructure project, dictating branding, objectives, and contractors (CPOs and EMSPs, for example); and aims to see a profitable return on their investment.



#########################################################
CPOs
#########################################################

What Does a Charge Point Operator Do?
A CPO ensures the EV charging stations it operates are operational, maintained, and readily available for electric car drivers at all times. An EV Charge Point Operator should provide stable EV charging systems today and future-proof for the certain expansion of EV infrastructure tomorrow while ensuring the scalability of EV charging stations.

A CPO needs to provide a smart charging management platform to help lower the total cost of ownership (TCO). Smart charging management tools and solutions include ways of improving EV charging energy demand during peak hours, energy storage systems to help save on energy costs, and making future-proofing a necessary step when installing EV charging stations.

What should Charge Point Operators (CPOs) care about?
CPOs should desire to make EV charging a smooth experience for EV drivers now and in the future.

Charge Point Operators should focus on ways to maximize profitability for the EMSP, optimize charging speeds for drivers, and ensure all EV drivers charging in one area are satisfied with power output. While power capacity is something that usually cannot be controlled once an EV charging system has been installed, a CPO can provide load balancing and low-peak electricity use options. This includes power distribution based on total power capacity and patterns of other sources of energy consumption and energy storage options.

Charge Point Operators vs Charge Point Owners
Charge Point Operators provide EV charging infrastructure, while Charge Point Owners own the charging infrastructure. Sometimes Charge Point Operators are also Charge Point Owners.

What is an e-mobility service provider (EMSP)?
AN EMSP provides a seamless EV charging experience for EV drivers which includes helping them locate the chargers, ensuring they’re encouraged to follow electric car etiquette, and providing payment methods.

An EMSP should have clear markings and signage for each EV charging station location. This helps EV drivers find EV chargers without issue and start their charging sessions quickly.

Electric vehicle charging etiquette includes charging for only as long as is needed, charging only when needed, and ensuring charging cords are stored away properly once a charging session is completed. Oftentimes, EV drivers consider parking in electric vehicle charging spots without actually needing a charge because they want to take advantage of parking at the best spots in the lot.

An EMSP should provide a variety of payment options so an EV driver won’t have an issue when it comes to paying for their charging session. Payment options include RFID cards, charge cards, subscription payment models, digital payment through a mobile app, or a digital withdrawal from a pre-established account.

What does an e-mobility service provider do?
An electric mobility service provider will work on meeting the charging needs of EV drivers, set pricing, and work to make EV charging an enjoyable experience for EV owners.

EMSPs usually strive to set fair pricing that also enforces good charging etiquette.

There are several ways EMSPs can set prices for charging:

Volume-based fee (per Kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity delivered)
Individual charging session fee (a flat fee for each charging session)
Duration-based fee (per minute or hour of charging)
Advertising revenue (EMSP collects advertising revenue from companies that advertise on screens at stations EV drivers view while waiting for their cars to charge)
What should an e-mobility service provider care about?
An EMSP should focus on improving the EV driver experience. This could be through roaming features, access to EV charging point data, providing a variety of EV charging station types, or offering loyalty rewards.

An EMSP can opt to participate in a roaming agreement to expand the number of public EV charging points available through its network. Roaming can be accomplished by a peer-to-peer connection or roaming hubs. The main reason why customers like EMSP with roaming features is it gives them more locations to charge at and for a similar rate they’re used to with their current EMSP.

An EMSP should share real-time electric vehicle charging station data with its customers. This data should include the state of charge, EV charging station type, supported plug types, pricing model, and expected charge time. This is an important feature that drivers often look for when they are charging at a public charging point. Real-time station data helps EV owners plan out how to occupy their time while waiting for their EVs to charge.

An EMSP can keep customers happy by providing different levels of charging. EV drivers need access to both Level 2 and DC fast chargers. For example, EV owners may be content with charging at a moderate speed when they plan to run errands, shop, or watch a movie while their cars are charging but want faster charging rates when they are driving long distances or only have time for quick stops.

Loyalty rewards an EMSP can offer include discounts to local retail stores near public charging points, a frequent charging point system that offers redemption points for merchandise or discounts, or subscription pricing for drivers that charge with the same EMSP network often.

What is the difference between an e-mobility service provider and charge point operator?
An EV Charge Point Operator focuses on providing tools for an e-mobility service provider to have operational EV chargers, while an e-mobility service provider focuses on offering the best EV charging experience for its customers. Without CPOs or EMSPs, an EV owner would not be able to charge in a public setting and there would be no US EV charging network.

A CPO could also take on the role of an EMSP or vice versa.

CPO
#########################################################

The Vital Role of a Charging Point Operator in Electric Vehicle Charging
A Charging Point Operator (CPO) is a company that owns and manages the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs). This includes the physical charging stations as well as the software and networks that connect them. CPOs play a critical role in the adoption of EVs by ensuring that drivers have access to reliable and convenient options to charge their vehicles while on the go: in other words, they foster the concept of Destination Charging. They are also responsible for installing, maintaining, and upgrading charging stations, as well as managing the billing and payment systems that enable drivers to use them.

CPOs can operate in a variety of business models, ranging from for-profit companies and public utilities. The EV chargers are becoming more and more part of the retail experience, and by partnering with a reliable CPO, businesses can alleviate the challenges associated with operating and maintaining their charging stations, allowing them to focus on their core operations while providing a valuable service to the growing community of electric vehicle users.



Challenges of operating an EV charging station without a CPO
Operating an EV charging station without a CPO is not impossible. With the right expertise and knowledge, businesses can successfully install and operate their own EV charging stations. However, this may require a significant investment in time, resources, and expertise – which may not be feasible for all businesses. We went deeper and listed the 4 main challenges of operations without a Charging Point Operator below:



#########################################################
CPOs
#########################################################

Role of Charging Point Operators (CPOs): The growth of the EV charging infrastructure in India wouldn’t have been possible without the efforts of Charging Point Operators (CPOs). These are companies or brands that own and operate EV charging station networks, providing services to EV drivers who need to charge their electric vehicles. CPOs play a crucial role in the EV charging infrastructure as they are responsible for installing, managing, and maintaining charging stations across various locations. Their charging stations are mostly powered by DC chargers instead of AC chargers, as it is not feasible to use AC chargers in public charging stations due to their slow charging speed. AC chargers are typically installed at individual homes, where car owners can leave their vehicle to charge overnight.

Working with Stakeholders: CPOs work closely with EV manufacturers, property owners, local governments, and other stakeholders to identify suitable locations for charging stations and negotiate contracts for their installation. They also handle the back-end operations of charging stations, including payment processing, customer support, and station maintenance, ensuring that charging stations are always functional and accessible to EV drivers.

Mobile App-based EV Charging Stations: As the charging stations are self-operated, every CPO builds its mobile app that EV owners can install to initiate charging on their own. The CPOs’ mobile apps make it easy for EV owners to locate the nearest charging station and pay for charging services. These apps also provide real-time information about the availability of charging stations and the estimated time it will take to charge an EV.

Serious players in the Charging Infrastructure: In India, there are many serious players in the EV charging infrastructure field, such as Tata Power, Jio-BP, ABB, Delta Electronics, Statiq, Charzer, and Charge Zone. These players have their networks of charging stations built in collaboration with places like housing societies, malls, highways, public parking areas, etc. They also have the franchisee model to collaborate with local businessmen. Interestingly, every CPO has its own niche, such as Kazam, which endeavors to build infrastructure using small shop owners who have some space in front of their shops, and Charzer, a Bangalore-based start-up that has partnered with a comprehensive society management system to build charging infrastructure in gated societies.

#########################################################
EV CPO
#########################################################
What is an EV Charge Point Operator (EV CPO)?
The EV Charge Point Operator (EV CPO) is the company who builds an EV charging network.

They can independently plan and execute the project or employ outsourced EV charging station contractors to install all the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) needed.
After installing the EVSE hardware, the CPO installs the firmware on charging stations.
The Charge Point Operator (EV CPO) is an important link in the e-Mobility chain of roles since it ensures optimal ongoing EV charging operations.

The EV CPO focuses on operational excellence, smart energy management, monitoring and control, scalability, and interoperability.
It looks after charging hardware and backend operations’ provided it has the right EV charging station management system.
The EV CPO must ensure the compatibility of its EV charging infrastructure with necessary protocols like OCPP, OCPI, and ISO 15118.

With that, he can ensure advanced charging functions like Smart EV charging, Plug and Charge, or V2G (Vehicle to Grid) technology are supported.
All of this combined ensures communications run smoothly.
CPO monetizes his role by having Electro mobility service providers (EMSP) as his customers or by being EMSP himself.

What is an Electro Mobility Service Provider (EMSP)?
The most important link in the e-Mobility chain is the Electro mobility service provider or EMSP.

This company brings EV Charging directly to the consumers – the electric vehicle drivers.
The EMSP, like any other business, enters the market to find customers, provide them with an excellent customer experience, and monetize on it, aka earning revenue.

In the business project planning phase, the EMSP must evaluate all the available EV charging solutions and select the best fit for his charging network.

An important part of the EV charging software is a white-label EV charging app that the EMSP will customize with its logo and according to its brand identity.

The EMSP applies its own branding to the charging station network.
That means that the users will see his logo on the charging stations, the charging app, invoices, and anything else related to the end-user, the customer.

This is the crucial step since EV Charging Software is the most critical factor for all further operations of the EV charging network.

The primary role of EMSP is to make life easier for EV drivers.

He does this by offering EV charging at its stations, providing a seamless charging experience, and managing all aspects of charging and billing the customers.

For a more detailed look into how EMSP sets price tariffs, pricing plans, subscriptions, what EV business models they can run, and how to monetize on it, read our blog on EV Charging Billing.

An EMSP must provide EV drivers with an excellent customer experience (CX).

One of the essential elements of this is providing access to as many own charging points as possible and further eliminating the range anxiety of EV drivers by implementing EV Charging roaming.

Of course, EV CPO must assist them with the EV charging network operating flawlessly.

What is an EV Charge Point Owner?
Because of the same acronym (CPO), some confuse Charge Point Operators and Charge Point Owners.

They are not, at least not in some cases.

The land on which EV charging stations stand is owned by the land owner.
The person or company who invests in buying the charging station and in its setup on-site is the Charge Point Owner.
The company that manages the station (or stations) and sells its services to EMSP is the Charge Point Operator.
A company can have all these roles, or every role can be a different company or a mix of roles.
When an EV CPO is mentioned in anything regarding EV Charging, we mean the Charge Point Operator.

EV CPO acronym stands for Charge Point Operator, not Charge Point Owner!

EV CPO vs. EMSP
Even in circles close to EV Charging, the two terms, EV CPO and EMSP, get confused.

The Electro mobility service provider and the Charge Point Operator are two critical and interrelated components of EV Charging.
But what exactly is the difference, and what are the responsibilities that set them apart?

A Charge Point Operator (EV CPO) is the one that physically sets up the stations.

Then he will get them to a state where they are ready to operate.

In today’s age, it’s almost a norm they install smart charging stations.

The Electro Mobility Service Provider then connects the stations to his Smart EV Charging software or Charging management system.

Consequently, from that moment on, the EMSP is in charge of “taking care of business” under his brand.

The EV CPO will only monitor and maintain the charging network so all is running smoothly.

The EMPS is creating revenue from various EV Charging business models.

He can earn revenue directly from charging or indirectly from other connected services (hotels, restaurants, stores,…).

The EV CPO only creates revenue by charging the EMSP for its services.

Can an EV CPO also be EMSP?
An EV CPO becomes an EMSP if he actively promotes his EV Charging network and starts to “sell EV Charging” directly to the EV drivers or companies (EV fleet).

In fact, it is logical for some big companies to be in both roles.

Shell, for example, is both the CPO and EMSP.

The company manages its charging network and, at the same time, provides EV charging services to end-users.

Also, many companies want to install charging stations.

They may need them for their employees, EV fleet management, or customers.

An interesting option for them is to use EV Charging as a service (EV Caas) instead of investing in their own charging stations.

Many predict that in the future, the EV Charging business will consolidate.

Large EV Charging companies (EMSP) will acquire smaller ones or push them out of the market.

In the end, the EV charging market will be dominated by only a few Electro mobility service providers (EMSP).


########################################################################
What is an EMP? What are the Functions and Responsibilities of an EMP?
########################################################################
The eMobility Provider (EMP), also known as a Mobility Service Provider (MSP), provides their customers with access to multiple charging station networks. Generally speaking, an EMP functions as a billing service provider – a third party that is authorized to bill for charging processes.

Functions and Responsibilities of an EMP

An EMP, through its contractual relationships, enables access for EV drivers/end users, to use multiple station networks (for a fee).
The EMP settles all financial transactions and is the direct contact person for end users.
This payment service is offered by ChargePoint in the product eMSP.OPERATION.
The EMP pays the invoice(s) to the charging station ooperators (CPO/CSO) directly.
The EMP specifies where their customers may charge.
