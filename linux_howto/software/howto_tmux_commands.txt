Ctrl-b then c to create a new window
Ctrl-b then n to switch to the next window

Ctrl-b then % to split the current window into panes vertically
Ctrl-b then " to split the current window into panes horizontally
Ctrl-b then ↑ to move to the above pane (works for all four arrows)
Ctrl-b then q to show pane numbers, then (optionally) the number to switch to that pane
Ctrl-b then ⎇↑ to resize the current pane up (works for all four arrows)
Ctrl-b then x to kill the current pane (or window if it only has one pane)
Ctrl-b then [ to enter copy mode, then four arrow keys to move,
even past the visible point, which is great for scrolling--I don't use it much for copying/pasting.

select-window [-lnpT] [-t target-window] (alias: selectw)

Select the window at target-window. -l, -n and -p are equivalent to the last-window, next-window and previous-window commands. If -T is given and the selected window is already the current window, the command behaves like last-window.
