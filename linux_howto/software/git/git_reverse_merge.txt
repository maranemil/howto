Revert a merged pull request

While you can't undo a pull request, you can revert the merged commit from a pull request if necessary. Bitbucket takes two steps to revert a pull request: 1) Bitbucket creates a new branch with one commit that reverses the merged commit. 2) Bitbucket creates a new pull request for the branch and commit.

To revert a pull request:

From the pull request, click the Revert button in the top right.

(Optional) From the Revert pull request dialog, change the Branch name for the new branch you're about to create.

Click the Revert button. Once you click Revert, Bitbucket creates the new branch. Even if you cancel the pull request, the revert branch remains in the repository.

The Create a pull request page opens with the revert branch as the source. After you add your reviewers and make additional changes, click Create.

git revert --no-commit 0766c053..HEAD
git commit

git reset --hard HEAD
git merge --abort

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git checkout <branch>
git pull
git log

revert the merge commit and push it:

git revert -m 1 <SHA-1>
git push

git revert -m 1 <SHA-1 (from clipboard)>
git push

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bitbucket has a "revert" button on Pull Requests now.

Note it doesn't automatically update the branch the original PR was merged into it. It creates a new branch with a commit that reverts the PR:

You then can create a PR from this branch and merge it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With bitbucket, we can't revert a merged pull request. The revert option which is present in the pull request will create a new branch with a new head(before this commit). That branch later you have to merge into your master/release branch. This is all as communicated by the official

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My recommended workflow is to create a new branch and revert this commit in a new branch. The reason for this is that on a team with a lot of developers, you rarely want to directly modify master.


Here the hash 6912d584f1 is the merge commit: it records that the branch tildedave/pull_request_demo was merged into master from Pull Request #1. This is the commit hash we’re going to revert.

# Always be current on your remote's origin master before doing anything!
> git checkout master
> git pull --rebase origin master
# Create a new branch
> git checkout -b revert_pull_request_1
Switched to a new branch 'revert_pull_request_1'
# Need to specify -m 1 because it is a merge commit
> git revert -m 1 6912d584f1
Finished one revert.
[revert_pull_request_1 cf09b44] Revert "Merge pull request #1 from tildedave/pull_request_demo"
 2 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 this-is-also-a-test-file
# Push your changes
> git push origin revert_pull_request_1

The next step is to merge your branch that reverts the pull request. Like every other change to master, this should be done through Github with the green button.
Once this has been merged, the original pull request has been reverted.

Step 3: Fix the Original Pull Request
After the original pull request has been reverted, we must fix it. The first thing we do here is to find the revert hash – this is the commit hash created by executing the git revert above.

The revert hash was given in the command results above, but you can also find it through Github by looking at the commit right before your merged revert pull request.

Now that we have the revert hash, we can make a new branch and revert the revert, then add additional commits to fix whatever was wrong with the branch.

> git pull --rebase origin master
