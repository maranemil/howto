0xy Arpeggio

Syntax: 0
x = semitone offset
y = semitone offset

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 037
··· ·· ·· 037
··· ·· ·· 037
··· ·· ·· 037

Explanation:
Arpeggio quickly alters the note pitch between the base note (C-4) and the semitone offsets x (3 = D#4) and y (7 = G-4). Each pitch is played for the duration of 1 tick. If speed is higher than 3 (meaning there are more than 3 ticks per row), the sequence is looped.
ProTracker 2/3

Base note is played for tick 0, then the semitone offset x for tick 1, then semitone offset y for tick 2.
Fasttracker II

Base note is played for tick 0, then the semitone offset y for tick 1, then semitone offset x for tick 2.

Notes:
In MilkyTracker you don't have to and indeed you CAN'T enter the effect digit 0. Just start with the parameter digits and the effect digit will be filled in.

Doesn't have effect memory and cannot be used without parameters.

In Fasttracker II, arpeggio logic fails when song speed is 16 (0x10) or higher. Using arpeggio at such speeds may cause unpredictable results across different players.

Tips:
When both effect parameters are used, it is wise to use a song speed value divisible by 3 in order that the arpeggio sequence can loop smoothly.

1xx Portamento up

Syntax: 1
xx = portamento speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 103
··· ·· ·· 103
··· ·· ·· 103
··· ·· ·· 103

Explanation:
Portamento is used to slide the note pitch up or down. The higher the xx, the faster it goes. Effect is applied on every tick.
Amiga frequencies

The slide speed also depends on the sample frequency.

Notes:
ProTracker 2/3

Doesn't have effect memory and cannot be used without parameters.

2xx Portamento down

Syntax: 2
xx = portamento speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 203
··· ·· ·· 203
··· ·· ·· 203
··· ·· ·· 203

Explanation:
Works similarly to 1xx portamento up, only bending note pitch down instead of up.
Notes:
ProTracker 2/3

Doesn't have effect memory and cannot be used without parameters.

3xx Portamento to note

Syntax: 3
xx = portamento speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
E-4 ·1 ·· 304
··· ·· ·· 300
··· ·· ·· 310

Explanation:

This portamento command bends the already playing note pitch towards another one, entered with the 3xx command. In the example, C-4 is bent towards E-4 at portamento speed 04 which isn't fast enough to reach the E-4 pitch during the two rows at the default song speed (6/125). However, 310 on the following row continues the portamento and being much faster, achieves the target E-4 pitch.

4xy Vibrato

Syntax: 4
x = speed
y = depth

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 481
··· ·· ·· 402
··· ·· ·· 400
··· ·· ·· 460

Explanation:

Vibrato alters note pitch up and down in the maximum range of a full tone. After the initial xy pair, parameters can be set individually. The pitch is reset when the command is discontinued.

5xy Portamento to note with volume slide

Syntax: 5
x = volume slide up speed
y = volume slide down speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
E-4 ·1 ·· 304
··· ·· ·· 504
··· ·· ·· 504

Explanation:

Performs portamento to note with parameters initialized with 3xx or Mx while sliding volume similarly to Axy volume slide.

Notes:

ProTracker 2/3
Doesn't have effect memory for volume slide speeds, 500 works identically to 300.

6xy Vibrato with volume slide

Syntax: 6
x = volume slide up speed
y = volume slide down speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 481
··· ·· ·· 601
··· ·· ·· 600
··· ·· ·· 6C0

Explanation:

Performs vibrato with parameters initialized with 4xy or Sx+Vx while sliding volume similarly to Axy volume slide.

Notes:

ProTracker 2/3
Doesn't have effect memory for volume slide speeds, 600 works identically to 400.

7xy Tremolo

Syntax: 7
x = speed
y = depth

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 787
··· ·· ·· 700
··· ·· ·· 7C0
··· ·· ·· 700

Explanation:

Tremolo alters note volume up and down. After the initial xy pair, parameters can be set individually. The volume is not reset when the command is discontinued.

8xx Set note panning position

Syntax: 8
xx = panning position

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 880
··· ·· ·· 8A0
··· ·· ·· 8C0
··· ·· ·· 8F0

Explanation:

Sets the note stereo panning from far left 00 to far right FF overriding sample panning setting.

Notes:

ProTracker 2/3

On Amiga, the 4 MOD channels are hard panned left, right, right and left by hardware, no use panning manually there.

Fasttracker II

Panning envelopes operate relative to the set position.

9xx Sample offset

Syntax: 9
xx = sample offset

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
C-4 ·1 ·· 908
··· ·· ·· ···

Explanation:

The sample that the note triggers is played from offset xx. The offsets are spread 256 samples apart so 908 skips the first (0x8*256=) 2048 bytes of the sample and plays it on from there. This means that the furthest point 9xx can reach is (0xFF*256 =) 65280 bytes into the sample.

Tips: Resampling a loop to exactly (0x10000=) 65536 bytes gives you the highest possible level of control over the sample.

Axy Volume slide

Syntax: A
x = volume slide up speed
y = volume slide down speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· A04
··· ·· ·· A04
C-4 ·1 ·· A0F
··· ·· ·· A80

Explanation:

Slides note volume up/down at speed x/y depending on which parameter is specified. Effect is applied per tick so song speed value acts as a multiplier.

Notes:

Parameters x and y should NOT be used at the same time, doing so almost guarantees unpredictable results across different players.

ProTracker 2/3

Doesn't have effect memory and cannot be used without parameters.

Bxx Jump to order

Syntax: B
xx = song position

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
··· ·· ·· B04

Explanation:

Immediately breaks the current pattern and jumps to order xx in the pattern order table (POT).

Tips:

Can be used to divide a song into separate looping sections effectively creating multiple songs using the same set of instruments. Such modules can be used in games and such where the sections can be triggered dynamically by program events.

Cxx Set note volume

Syntax: C
xx = volume

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· C10
··· ·· ·· C40
··· ·· ·· C00

Explanation:

Sets the note volume 00 – 40 overriding sample volume setting.

Notes:

Fasttracker II

Volume envelopes operate relative to the set volume.

Dxx Pattern break

Syntax: D
xx = row number on next pattern

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
··· ·· ·· D04

Explanation:

Breaks the current pattern and jumps to row xx on the next pattern.

Notes:

Unlike with the majority of effect parameters, here xx is a decimal value rather than hexadecimal. Hexadecimal values are accepted but the first digit is still interpreted as decimal so it's best to avoid hex this time.

The highest row number you can jump to is 63.

E1x Fine portamento up

Syntax: E1
x = portamento speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E11
··· ·· ·· E12
··· ·· ·· E13
··· ·· ·· E14

Explanation:

Works similarly to 1xx portamento up, only the slide is a lot finer because the effect is applied only once per row.

E2x Fine portamento down

Syntax: E2
x = portamento speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E11
··· ·· ·· E12
··· ·· ·· E13
··· ·· ·· E14

Explanation:

Works similarly to 2xx portamento down bending note pitch down, only the slide is a lot finer like with E1x.

E3x Glissando control

Syntax: E3
x = glissando control toggle on/off

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E31
D-4 01 ·· 305
··· ·· ·· 300
··· ·· ·· E30

Explanation:

Glissando control E31 changes note portamento behavior affecting commands 3xx, 5xy and Mx. Instead of stepless pitch bend (=glissando), the frequencies are rounded to nearest semitone. To revert to default glissando, use E30.

Notes:

This command is not yet implemented in MilkyTracker.

E4x Vibrato control

Syntax: E4
x = vibrato waveform selection

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 48C
··· ·· V0 E41
··· ·· V0 E42
··· ·· ·· E40

Explanation:

This command sets the waveform used for 4xy, 6xy and Vx vibrato commands. The default waveform is sine, reset on every new note (E40). Possible parameter x values are:

0 = Sine
1 = Ramp down
2 = Square
4 = Continuous sine
5 = Continuous ramp down
6 = Continuous square

Notes:

This command is not yet implemented in MilkyTracker.

E5x Set note fine-tune

Syntax: E5
x = fine-tune

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E54
··· ·· ·· ···
C-4 ·1 ·· E5C
··· ·· ·· ···

Explanation:

Sets note fine-tune overriding sample fine-tune setting. This command works a little differently for .MOD and .XM tracking. While both parameter value ranges are logical, the latter is also linear. See here:
x ProTracker 2/3 Fasttracker II
0 0 -128
1 +16 -112
2 +32 -96
3 +48 -80
4 +64 -64
5 +80 -48
6 +96 -32
7 +112 -16
8 -128 0
9 -112 +16
A -96 +32
B -80 +48
C -64 +64
D -48 +80
E -32 +96
F -16 +112

E6x Pattern loop

Syntax: E6
x = set loop point / number of iterations

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E60
··· ·· ·· ···
F-4 01 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· E63

Explanation:

Loops a section of a pattern x times. E60 sets the (optional) loop start point and E6x with x values 1–F sets the end point and the number of iterations. If loop start point is not set, beginning of the pattern is used by default.

Notes:

The loop points need to be set on the same channel for them to work correctly.

Fasttracker II

One of the most (in)famous FT2 bugs is the E60 bug: When E60 is used on a pattern row x, the following pattern also starts from row x instead of the beginning of the pattern. This can be avoided by placing a D00 pattern break on the last row of the pattern where E60 was used.
Tips: Musicians concerned with correct playback of their .XM modules can utilize the E60 bug to skip sections of (or the whole) song when played with lesser players. ;)

E7x Tremolo control

Syntax: E7
x = tremolo waveform selection

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E72
··· ·· ·· 76C
··· ·· ·· E70
··· ·· ·· 700

Explanation:

This command sets the waveform used for 7xy tremolo command. As with E4x vibrato control, the default waveform is sine and the possible parameter x values are:

0 = Sine
1 = Ramp down
2 = Square
4 = Continuous sine
5 = Continuous ramp down
6 = Continuous square

Notes:

This command is not yet implemented in MilkyTracker.

E8x Set note panning position

Syntax: E8
x = panning position

Explanation:

This command is another panning position command used by some trackers…

Notes:

…However, since it does not work on Amiga (because of the hardware panning) nor in Fasttracker II (hmm, enough panning commands already?), effect relocation to 8xx or Px is advised in order to produce compatible modules.

E9x Re-trigger note

Syntax: E9
x = triggering interval

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E93
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
C-4 ·1 ·· ···

Explanation:

This command re-triggers a note every x ticks.

EAx Fine volume slide up

Syntax: EA
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 10 EA2
··· ·· ·· EA0
··· ·· ·· EA4
··· ·· ·· EA0

Explanation:

Works similarly to Ax0 volume slide up, only the slide is a lot finer because the effect is applied only once per row.

EBx Fine volume slide down

Syntax: EB
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· EB2
··· ·· ·· EB0
··· ·· ·· EB4
··· ·· ·· EB0

Explanation:

Works similarly to A0y volume slide down, only the slide is a lot finer like with EAx.

ECx Note cut

Syntax: EC
x = tick number

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· EC1
C-4 ·1 ·· EC2
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· EC0

Explanation:

Cuts a note by setting its volume to 0 at tick precision. Possible parameter x values are 0 – (song speed - 1). Higher values have no effect.

EDx Note delay

Syntax: ED
x = tick number

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
A#3 01 ·· ED3
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···

Explanation:

Delays a note x ticks. Like with ECx note cut, possible x values are 0 – (song speed - 1). Higher values prevent the note from playing altogether.

EEx Pattern delay

Syntax: EE
x = amount of rows

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
A#3 01 ·· EE5
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···

Explanation:

Delays playback progression for the duration of x rows.

Fxx Set song speed/BPM

Syntax: F
xx = speed/BPM value

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· F90
A#3 01 ·· F03
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···

Explanation:

Parameter x values 01 – 1F set song speed i.e. the amount of ticks per row. Values 20 – FF set the BPM which essentially is the speed of the ticks. F00 stops playback.

Gxx Set global volume

Syntax: G
xx = volume

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· G40
··· ·· ·· G20
··· ·· ·· G10
··· ·· ·· G00

Explanation:

Sets the global song note volume 00 – 40.

Hxy Global volume slide

Syntax: H
x = volume slide up speed
y = volume slide down speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· H04
··· ·· ·· H04
C-4 ·1 ·· H0F
··· ·· ·· H80

Explanation:

Slides global song volume up/down at speed x/y depending on which parameter is specified.

Notes:

Parameters x and y should NOT be used at the same time, doing so almost guarantees unpredictable results across different players.

Kxx Key-off

Syntax: K
xx = tick number

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· K03
··· ·· ·· ···
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· K00

Explanation:

Sends instrument key-off much like the note column counterpart, only in tick precision. As K00 is the equivalent of a note column key-off, it cancels any actual note on the row. Possible parameter xx values are 00 – (song speed - 1). Higher values have no effect.

Lxx Set volume envelope position

Syntax: L
xx = volume envelope position

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· L20
··· ·· ·· ···
··· ·· ·· L00
··· ·· ·· ···

Explanation:

Makes the currently playing note jump to tick xx on the volume envelope timeline.

Pxy Panning slide

Syntax: P
x = panning slide right speed
y = panning slide left speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· P04
··· ·· ·· P00
··· ·· ·· P80
··· ·· ·· P00

Explanation:

Slides note panning right/left at speed x/y depending on which parameter is specified. Effect is applied per tick so song speed acts as a multiplier.

Notes:

Parameters x and y should NOT be used at the same time, doing so almost guarantees unpredictable results across different players.

Rxy Re-trigger note with volume slide

Syntax: R
x = volume slide speed
y = triggering interval

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· R81
··· ·· ·· R12
··· ·· ·· R23
··· ·· ·· R04

Explanation:

Much like E9x, this command rapidly re-triggers a note while sliding its volume. Parameter x values affect note volume like this:

0 = previous x value
1 = - 1
2 = - 2
3 = - 4
4 = - 8
5 = -16
6 = * 0.66666666666666666666666666666667
7 = * 0.5
8 = no volume change
9 = + 1
A = + 2
B = + 4
C = + 8
D = +16
E = * 1.5
F = * 2

Notes:

This command is very buggy from the start, straight from the source, Fasttracker II. While FT2's own documentation is inaccurate in many places, this is different. Extensive testing has revealed almost bizarre qualities of this effect and it's up to MilkyTracker to emulate it all. Without doubt the quirk the team has spent the most time and iterations working on getting it right. And still we advise to be careful with it. When using Rxy, check your song with FT2 (render to .WAV if you don't have the hardware (to emulate)), or at least BASS/XMPlay. And if you do find something odd, please report the bug as accurately and detailed as possible.

Setting volume on the volume column (xx) at the same time with Rxy resets the volume to xx before each re-trigger making the effect sound different.

Tips

Use R8y instead of R0y when you want to keep the volume unchanged, these two x values are often documented inaccurately as "No volume change" and "Unused", respectively.

Txy Tremor

Syntax: T
x + 1 = ticks on
y + 1 = ticks off

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· T13
··· ·· ·· T00
··· ·· ·· T31
··· ·· ·· T00

Explanation:

Rapidly alters note volume from full to zero, x + 1 and y + 1 setting the duration of the states in ticks.

Notes:

Using T00 makes a fast tremor effect but it also functions as effect memory repeating the last parameters. So you can only use this 00 speed once per channel before you use any other parameter values.

X1x Extra fine portamento up

Syntax: X1
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· X11
··· ·· ·· X10
··· ·· ·· X18
··· ·· ·· X10

Explanation:

Works just like E1x fine portamento up, only with 4 times the precision.

X2x Extra fine portamento down

Syntax: X2
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· X11
··· ·· ·· X20
··· ·· ·· X28
··· ·· ·· X20

Explanation:

Works just like E2x fine portamento down, only with 4 times the precision like E1x extra fine portamento up.

xx Set note volume

Syntax: xx = volume

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· 10 ···
··· ·· 40 ···
··· ·· 00 ···

Explanation:

Sets the note volume 00 – 40 overriding sample volume setting. This is what the volume column is primarily used for, hence no effect command character. It's the equivalent of Cxx set note volume on the effect column.

+x Volume slide up

Syntax: +
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 10 ···
··· ·· +2 ···
··· ·· +4 ···
··· ·· +8 ···

Explanation:

Slides note volume up at speed x with the song speed (ticks) acting as a multiplier like with Ax0 volume slide on the effect column.

-x Volume slide down

Syntax: -
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· -2 ···
··· ·· -4 ···
··· ·· -8 ···

Explanation:

Slides note volume down at speed x with the song speed (ticks) acting as a multiplier like with A0y volume slide on the effect column.

Dx Fine volume slide down (displayed as ▼x)

Syntax: D
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ▼2 ···
··· ·· ▼4 ···
··· ·· ▼8 ···

Explanation:

This is the volume column equivalent of EBx fine volume slide down, effect is applied once per row.

Lx Panning slide left (displayed as ◀x)

Syntax: L
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ◀2 ···
··· ·· ◀4 ···
··· ·· ◀8 ···

Explanation:

Slides note panning left at speed x with the song speed value (ticks) acting as a multiplier like with P0x volume slide on the effect column.

Mx Portamento to note

Syntax: M
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
E-4 01 ·· 304
··· ·· M0 ···
··· ·· M1 ···

Explanation:

This is the volume column equivalent of 3xx portamento, only with 1 digit resolution. M1 corresponds to 311, M2 to 322 and so on…

Tips:

3xx and Mx share effect memory, so it's possible to initialize a portamento with a more precise 3xx value and sustain it with M0 freeing the effect column for arpeggios, note delays, tremolo or whatever.

Px Set note panning position

Syntax: P
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 P4 ···
··· ·· ·· ···
··· ·· PC ···
··· ·· ·· ···

Explanation:

This is the volume column equivalent of 8xx panning, only with 1 digit resolution. P8 corresponds to 888, P9 to 899 and so on…

Tips:

3xx and Mx share effect memory, so it's possible to initialize a portamento with a more precise 3xx value and sustain it with M0 freeing the effect column for arpeggios, note delays, tremolo or whatever.

Rx Panning slide right (displayed as ▶x)

Syntax: R
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ▶2 ···
··· ·· ▶4 ···
··· ·· ▶8 ···

Explanation:

Slides note panning right at speed x with the song speed value (ticks) acting as a multiplier like with Px0 volume slide on the effect column.

Sx Set vibrato speed

Syntax: S
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 48F
··· ·· S4 A01
··· ·· ·· 600
··· ·· ·· 400

Explanation:

Sets the vibrato speed like the x in 4xy vibrato. In the example it is used instead of 4xy to free up the effect column.

Ux Fine volume slide up (displayed as ▲x)

Syntax: U
x = speed

Example:
C-4 ·1 10 ···
··· ·· ▲2 ···
··· ·· ▲4 ···
··· ·· ▲8 ···

Explanation:

This is the volume column equivalent of EAx fine volume slide up, effect is applied once per row.

Vx Vibrato

Syntax: V
x = depth

Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 484
··· ·· V0 ···
··· ·· V8 ···
··· ·· V0 ···

Explanation:

Performs vibrato with depth x but requires the speed component to be initialized with 4x0 or Sx.

Notes:

Note pitch isn't reset when the command is discontinued.
