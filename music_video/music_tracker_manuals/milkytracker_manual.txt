Hello and welcome to MilkyTracker, an open source multi-platform Fasttracker II compatible music tracker program.
This document holds a lot of valuable information about the tracker but it's not a tracking manual.
If you want to learn more about tracking and how it's done, the Internet is your friend. We host some resources on MilkyTracker.org as well.

Disclaimer:
MilkyTracker is under development so use it at your own risk.
The team is not responsible for any loss of data and/or hardware damage caused by MilkyTracker.

Now, with the formalities taken care of, let's have a look at the…

You can run MilkyTracker on other platforms by compiling from source.

2. Overview
MilkyTracker is an open source, multi-platform music application; more specifically part of the tracker family.
It attempts to recreate the module replay and user experience of the popular DOS application Fasttracker II,
with special playback modes available for improved Amiga ProTracker 2.x/3.x compatibility.
MilkyTracker is not "another Windows tracker", which should already be made obvious by the plethora
of supported desktop and portable platforms. In fact it started as a project to bring tracking to the Pocket PC.
When this milestone was reached, the next one was creating a truly FT2 compatible tracker for portable as well
as modern desktop platforms.

3. Features
Fasttracker II-like, custom graphical user interface with context menus
Supported on multiple platforms including portable devices
Very accurate .XM replay compared to FT2
ProTracker 2/3 playback modes for playing and editing .MOD files
Various resampler options including emulated Amiga 500/1200 sound output
Choose between a modern and a true-to-FT2 editing scheme / keyboard layout
Tabbed user interface for opening and playing up to 32 modules simultaneously and for exchanging data between them
Over 30 imported module formats
Basic archive support for loading zipped, powerpacked and UMX modules directly
Rendering songs/patterns to disk (.WAV) or directly to sample
Powerful sample editor featuring waveform generators
In-depth instrument editor featuring envelope zooming and scaling and support for copying and swapping instruments and samples across tabs
Copy/swap dialog for instrument management
Undo/redo in pattern/sample/instrument editor
Low latency audio driver support
MIDI In support
Module optimizer
Internal file browser option
Various font sizes for improved visibility of pattern data
Prospective pattern view option
Playing and editing simultaneously
Live mode for seamless pattern changes
Resamplers
MilkyTracker offers various resampling options for module playback, rendering and sample processing. These are:

No interpolation
Linear interpolation
Cubic Lagrange
Cubic Spline
Fast Sinc (window size 16, fixed point integer, sinc lookup table)
Precise Sinc (window size 128, double floating point)
Amiga 500
Amiga 500 LED
Amiga 1200
Amiga 1200 LED
While the choice of resampler is a matter of personal taste, you should keep in mind that Linear interpolation represents the highest quality option available in Fasttracker II so that's what the majority of .XM files were probably made (to be played) with. Many chiptunes will however sound very muffled with interpolation because of their short samples and therefore relatively greater impact of interpolation. The Amiga modes are meant to be used with 4 channel .MODs only. Precise Sinc is a CPU killer - great for resampling in the sample editor but don't expect hot real-time performance.

Tabs
MilkyTracker enables you to open and play up to 32 modules simultaneously and to exchange data between them. Initially, tabs are invisible but can be activated with keyboard shortcuts described below. There are some configurable options for tabs as well, like automatically opening modules in new tabs and background stopping behavior control. You can choose to never stop playback on background tabs, or to automatically stop on tab change or stop when playback on another tab is started. Playback can also resume upon returning to a tab.

4. Imported and exported file formats
I. Modules
MilkyTracker can import a wide range of tracker module formats but since Milky is a FT2 clone, modules are replayed in an FT2 environment which means not all features of different formats are supported. MilkyTracker also has basic archive support, so it's possible to load zipped, powerpacked and UMX modules directly.

IV. Patterns and Tracks
MilkyTracker handles FT2's eXtended Pattern (.XP) and eXtended Track (.XT) files with full compatibility.

5. Keyboard shortcuts
By user request, MilkyTracker features two edit modes. You can switch between these in the Config screen (Misc. tab). To learn about the differences and which might better suit you, read the appropriate sections below. There are a couple of shortcuts that are the same for both modes so let's clear those out of the way first:

Please note that under Mac OS X the Command key is used instead of the Ctrl key.

Alt-Enter	Switch between full screen and windowed display (Windows & SDL)
Alt-Command-F	Switch between full screen and windowed display (OS X)
Shift-M	Mute current channel
Ctrl-Shift-M	Invert muting
Shift-U	Un-mute all
Ctrl-Shift-T	Open a new tab
Ctrl-Shift-W	Close current tab
Ctrl-Shift-Left	Select previous tab
Ctrl-Shift-Right	Select next tab
Ctrl-=	Increment instrument number of all notes in the current selection
Ctrl--	Decrement instrument number of all notes in the current selection
Ctrl-Shift-=	Increment instrument number of all notes in the current track under the cursor
Ctrl-Shift--	Decrement instrument number of all notes in the current track under the cursor
I. MilkyTracker edit mode
The MilkyTracker mode basically is a bit more "modern" because you can focus on different parts (e.g. Pattern Editor, Instrument listbox, Sample listbox etc.) and when you're pressing keys, they're routed to the focused control. Keyboard shortcuts are also more standard; you can select by pressing the SHIFT key and navigating with the cursor keys, cut, copy & paste by using Ctrl-X/C/V etc. Users who are new to tracking will probably find this a bit more intuitive.

II. Fasttracker II edit mode
The FT2 edit mode is for the die-hard FT2 users and probably isn't very intuitive to beginners. Please note that not all FT2 shortcuts are implemented yet and some may differ for various technical reasons. Also note that this edit mode may not be optimal on Pocket PC because of the limitations of some input devices.

6. Effect command reference
I. Glossary
BPM	Traditionally Beats Per Minute, but in tracker terminology it defines the speed of ticks.
Effect memory	When an effect command is called with 0 parameters, previous parameters are used.
Row/line	Refers to one line of "text" on a pattern. In playback its duration depends on how many ticks there are per row (Speed) and fast they are (BPM).
Sample fine-tune/volume/panning	Per sample default settings available through the instrument editor (thus also called instrument volume etc). Overrideable with effect commands. .MODs support these as well but with lower precision. (Save module and load back to enforce .MOD precision.)
Tick	The base time unit in traditional trackers like MilkyTracker, originating from Amiga. Notes are triggered on the first tick of a row (unless delayed) and effects are applied on the following ticks.
Semitone	The smallest musical interval in Western music and in MilkyTracker. A C# note is one semitone away from the note C.
Speed (Spd.)	Number of ticks per row.

0xy Arpeggio
Syntax:	0
x = semitone offset
y = semitone offset
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 037
··· ·· ·· 037
··· ·· ·· 037
··· ·· ·· 037
Explanation:
Arpeggio quickly alters the note pitch between the base note (C-4) and the semitone offsets x (3 = D#4) and y (7 = G-4). Each pitch is played for the duration of 1 tick. If speed is higher than 3 (meaning there are more than 3 ticks per row), the sequence is looped.

ProTracker 2/3
Base note is played for tick 0, then the semitone offset x for tick 1, then semitone offset y for tick 2.

Fasttracker II
Base note is played for tick 0, then the semitone offset y for tick 1, then semitone offset x for tick 2.

Notes:
In MilkyTracker you don't have to and indeed you CAN'T enter the effect digit 0. Just start with the parameter digits and the effect digit will be filled in.

Doesn't have effect memory and cannot be used without parameters.

In Fasttracker II, arpeggio logic fails when song speed is 16 (0x10) or higher. Using arpeggio at such speeds may cause unpredictable results across different players.

Tips:
When both effect parameters are used, it is wise to use a song speed value divisible by 3 in order that the arpeggio sequence can loop smoothly.

1xx Portamento up
Syntax:	1
xx = portamento speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 103
··· ·· ·· 103
··· ·· ·· 103
··· ·· ·· 103
Explanation:
Portamento is used to slide the note pitch up or down. The higher the xx, the faster it goes. Effect is applied on every tick.

Amiga frequencies
The slide speed also depends on the sample frequency.

Notes:
ProTracker 2/3
Doesn't have effect memory and cannot be used without parameters.

2xx Portamento down
Syntax:	2
xx = portamento speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 203
··· ·· ·· 203
··· ·· ·· 203
··· ·· ·· 203
Explanation:	Works similarly to 1xx portamento up, only bending note pitch down instead of up.
Notes:
ProTracker 2/3
Doesn't have effect memory and cannot be used without parameters.

3xx Portamento to note
Syntax:	3
xx = portamento speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
E-4 ·1 ·· 304
··· ·· ·· 300
··· ·· ·· 310
Explanation:
This portamento command bends the already playing note pitch towards another one, entered with the 3xx command. In the example, C-4 is bent towards E-4 at portamento speed 04 which isn't fast enough to reach the E-4 pitch during the two rows at the default song speed (6/125). However, 310 on the following row continues the portamento and being much faster, achieves the target E-4 pitch.

4xy Vibrato
Syntax:	4
x = speed
y = depth
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 481
··· ·· ·· 402
··· ·· ·· 400
··· ·· ·· 460
Explanation:
Vibrato alters note pitch up and down in the maximum range of a full tone. After the initial xy pair, parameters can be set individually. The pitch is reset when the command is discontinued.

5xy Portamento to note with volume slide
Syntax:	5
x = volume slide up speed
y = volume slide down speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
E-4 ·1 ·· 304
··· ·· ·· 504
··· ·· ·· 504
Explanation:
Performs portamento to note with parameters initialized with 3xx or Mx while sliding volume similarly to Axy volume slide.

Notes:
ProTracker 2/3
Doesn't have effect memory for volume slide speeds, 500 works identically to 300.

6xy Vibrato with volume slide
Syntax:	6
x = volume slide up speed
y = volume slide down speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 481
··· ·· ·· 601
··· ·· ·· 600
··· ·· ·· 6C0
Explanation:
Performs vibrato with parameters initialized with 4xy or Sx+Vx while sliding volume similarly to Axy volume slide.

Notes:
ProTracker 2/3
Doesn't have effect memory for volume slide speeds, 600 works identically to 400.

7xy Tremolo
Syntax:	7
x = speed
y = depth
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 787
··· ·· ·· 700
··· ·· ·· 7C0
··· ·· ·· 700
Explanation:
Tremolo alters note volume up and down. After the initial xy pair, parameters can be set individually. The volume is not reset when the command is discontinued.

8xx Set note panning position
Syntax:	8
xx = panning position
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 880
··· ·· ·· 8A0
··· ·· ·· 8C0
··· ·· ·· 8F0
Explanation:
Sets the note stereo panning from far left 00 to far right FF overriding sample panning setting.

Notes:
ProTracker 2/3
On Amiga, the 4 MOD channels are hard panned left, right, right and left by hardware, no use panning manually there.
Fasttracker II
Panning envelopes operate relative to the set position.

9xx Sample offset
Syntax:	9
xx = sample offset
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
C-4 ·1 ·· 908
··· ·· ·· ···
Explanation:
The sample that the note triggers is played from offset xx. The offsets are spread 256 samples apart so 908 skips the first (0x8*256=) 2048 bytes of the sample and plays it on from there. This means that the furthest point 9xx can reach is (0xFF*256 =) 65280 bytes into the sample.

Tips:	Resampling a loop to exactly (0x10000=) 65536 bytes gives you the highest possible level of control over the sample.
Axy Volume slide
Syntax:	A
x = volume slide up speed
y = volume slide down speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· A04
··· ·· ·· A04
C-4 ·1 ·· A0F
··· ·· ·· A80
Explanation:
Slides note volume up/down at speed x/y depending on which parameter is specified. Effect is applied per tick so song speed value acts as a multiplier.

Notes:
Parameters x and y should NOT be used at the same time, doing so almost guarantees unpredictable results across different players.
ProTracker 2/3
Doesn't have effect memory and cannot be used without parameters.

Bxx Jump to order
Syntax:	B
xx = song position
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
··· ·· ·· B04
Explanation:
Immediately breaks the current pattern and jumps to order xx in the pattern order table (POT).

Tips:
Can be used to divide a song into separate looping sections effectively creating multiple songs using the same set of instruments. Such modules can be used in games and such where the sections can be triggered dynamically by program events.

Cxx Set note volume
Syntax:	C
xx = volume
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· C10
··· ·· ·· C40
··· ·· ·· C00
Explanation:
Sets the note volume 00 – 40 overriding sample volume setting.

Notes:
Fasttracker II
Volume envelopes operate relative to the set volume.

Dxx Pattern break
Syntax:	D
xx = row number on next pattern
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
··· ·· ·· D04
Explanation:
Breaks the current pattern and jumps to row xx on the next pattern.

Notes:
Unlike with the majority of effect parameters, here xx is a decimal value rather than hexadecimal. Hexadecimal values are accepted but the first digit is still interpreted as decimal so it's best to avoid hex this time.

The highest row number you can jump to is 63.

E1x Fine portamento up
Syntax:	E1
x = portamento speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E11
··· ·· ·· E12
··· ·· ·· E13
··· ·· ·· E14
Explanation:
Works similarly to 1xx portamento up, only the slide is a lot finer because the effect is applied only once per row.

E2x Fine portamento down
Syntax:	E2
x = portamento speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E11
··· ·· ·· E12
··· ·· ·· E13
··· ·· ·· E14
Explanation:
Works similarly to 2xx portamento down bending note pitch down, only the slide is a lot finer like with E1x.

E3x Glissando control
Syntax:	E3
x = glissando control toggle on/off
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E31
D-4 01 ·· 305
··· ·· ·· 300
··· ·· ·· E30
Explanation:
Glissando control E31 changes note portamento behavior affecting commands 3xx, 5xy and Mx. Instead of stepless pitch bend (=glissando), the frequencies are rounded to nearest semitone. To revert to default glissando, use E30.

Notes:
This command is not yet implemented in MilkyTracker.

E4x Vibrato control
Syntax:	E4
x = vibrato waveform selection
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 48C
··· ·· V0 E41
··· ·· V0 E42
··· ·· ·· E40
Explanation:
This command sets the waveform used for 4xy, 6xy and Vx vibrato commands. The default waveform is sine, reset on every new note (E40). Possible parameter x values are:

0 = Sine
1 = Ramp down
2 = Square
4 = Continuous sine
5 = Continuous ramp down
6 = Continuous square
Notes:
This command is not yet implemented in MilkyTracker.

E5x Set note fine-tune
Syntax:	E5
x = fine-tune
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E54
··· ·· ·· ···
C-4 ·1 ·· E5C
··· ·· ·· ···
Explanation:
Sets note fine-tune overriding sample fine-tune setting. This command works a little differently for .MOD and .XM tracking. While both parameter value ranges are logical, the latter is also linear. See here:

x	ProTracker 2/3	Fasttracker II
0	0	-128
1	+16	-112
2	+32	-96
3	+48	-80
4	+64	-64
5	+80	-48
6	+96	-32
7	+112	-16
8	-128	0
9	-112	+16
A	-96	+32
B	-80	+48
C	-64	+64
D	-48	+80
E	-32	+96
F	-16	+112
E6x Pattern loop
Syntax:	E6
x = set loop point / number of iterations
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E60
··· ·· ·· ···
F-4 01 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· E63
Explanation:
Loops a section of a pattern x times. E60 sets the (optional) loop start point and E6x with x values 1–F sets the end point and the number of iterations. If loop start point is not set, beginning of the pattern is used by default.

Notes:
The loop points need to be set on the same channel for them to work correctly.

Fasttracker II
One of the most (in)famous FT2 bugs is the E60 bug: When E60 is used on a pattern row x, the following pattern also starts from row x instead of the beginning of the pattern. This can be avoided by placing a D00 pattern break on the last row of the pattern where E60 was used.

Tips:	Musicians concerned with correct playback of their .XM modules can utilize the E60 bug to skip sections of (or the whole) song when played with lesser players. ;)
E7x Tremolo control
Syntax:	E7
x = tremolo waveform selection
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E72
··· ·· ·· 76C
··· ·· ·· E70
··· ·· ·· 700
Explanation:
This command sets the waveform used for 7xy tremolo command. As with E4x vibrato control, the default waveform is sine and the possible parameter x values are:

0 = Sine
1 = Ramp down
2 = Square
4 = Continuous sine
5 = Continuous ramp down
6 = Continuous square
Notes:
This command is not yet implemented in MilkyTracker.

E8x Set note panning position
Syntax:	E8
x = panning position
Explanation:
This command is another panning position command used by some trackers…

Notes:
…However, since it does not work on Amiga (because of the hardware panning) nor in Fasttracker II (hmm, enough panning commands already?), effect relocation to 8xx or Px is advised in order to produce compatible modules.

E9x Re-trigger note
Syntax:	E9
x = triggering interval
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· E93
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
Explanation:
This command re-triggers a note every x ticks.

EAx Fine volume slide up
Syntax:	EA
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 10 EA2
··· ·· ·· EA0
··· ·· ·· EA4
··· ·· ·· EA0
Explanation:
Works similarly to Ax0 volume slide up, only the slide is a lot finer because the effect is applied only once per row.

EBx Fine volume slide down
Syntax:	EB
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· EB2
··· ·· ·· EB0
··· ·· ·· EB4
··· ·· ·· EB0
Explanation:
Works similarly to A0y volume slide down, only the slide is a lot finer like with EAx.

ECx Note cut
Syntax:	EC
x = tick number
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· EC1
C-4 ·1 ·· EC2
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· EC0
Explanation:
Cuts a note by setting its volume to 0 at tick precision. Possible parameter x values are 0 – (song speed - 1). Higher values have no effect.

EDx Note delay
Syntax:	ED
x = tick number
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
A#3 01 ·· ED3
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
Explanation:
Delays a note x ticks. Like with ECx note cut, possible x values are 0 – (song speed - 1). Higher values prevent the note from playing altogether.

EEx Pattern delay
Syntax:	EE
x = amount of rows
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
A#3 01 ·· EE5
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
Explanation:
Delays playback progression for the duration of x rows.

Fxx Set song speed/BPM
Syntax:	F
xx = speed/BPM value
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· F90
A#3 01 ·· F03
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· ···
Explanation:
Parameter x values 01 – 1F set song speed i.e. the amount of ticks per row. Values 20 – FF set the BPM which essentially is the speed of the ticks. F00 stops playback.

Gxx Set global volume
Syntax:	G
xx = volume
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· G40
··· ·· ·· G20
··· ·· ·· G10
··· ·· ·· G00
Explanation:
Sets the global song note volume 00 – 40.

Hxy Global volume slide
Syntax:	H
x = volume slide up speed
y = volume slide down speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· H04
··· ·· ·· H04
C-4 ·1 ·· H0F
··· ·· ·· H80
Explanation:
Slides global song volume up/down at speed x/y depending on which parameter is specified.

Notes:
Parameters x and y should NOT be used at the same time, doing so almost guarantees unpredictable results across different players.

Kxx Key-off
Syntax:	K
xx = tick number
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· K03
··· ·· ·· ···
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ·· K00
Explanation:
Sends instrument key-off much like the note column counterpart, only in tick precision. As K00 is the equivalent of a note column key-off, it cancels any actual note on the row. Possible parameter xx values are 00 – (song speed - 1). Higher values have no effect.

Lxx Set volume envelope position
Syntax:	L
xx = volume envelope position
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· L20
··· ·· ·· ···
··· ·· ·· L00
··· ·· ·· ···
Explanation:
Makes the currently playing note jump to tick xx on the volume envelope timeline.

Pxy Panning slide
Syntax:	P
x = panning slide right speed
y = panning slide left speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· P04
··· ·· ·· P00
··· ·· ·· P80
··· ·· ·· P00
Explanation:
Slides note panning right/left at speed x/y depending on which parameter is specified. Effect is applied per tick so song speed acts as a multiplier.

Notes:
Parameters x and y should NOT be used at the same time, doing so almost guarantees unpredictable results across different players.

Rxy Re-trigger note with volume slide
Syntax:	R
x = volume slide speed
y = triggering interval
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· R81
··· ·· ·· R12
··· ·· ·· R23
··· ·· ·· R04
Explanation:
Much like E9x, this command rapidly re-triggers a note while sliding its volume. Parameter x values affect note volume like this:

0 = previous x value
1 = - 1
2 = - 2
3 = - 4
4 = - 8
5 = -16
6 = * 0.66666666666666666666666666666667
7 = * 0.5
8 = no volume change
9 = + 1
A = + 2
B = + 4
C = + 8
D = +16
E = * 1.5
F = * 2
Notes:
This command is very buggy from the start, straight from the source, Fasttracker II. While FT2's own documentation is inaccurate in many places, this is different. Extensive testing has revealed almost bizarre qualities of this effect and it's up to MilkyTracker to emulate it all. Without doubt the quirk the team has spent the most time and iterations working on getting it right. And still we advise to be careful with it. When using Rxy, check your song with FT2 (render to .WAV if you don't have the hardware (to emulate)), or at least BASS/XMPlay. And if you do find something odd, please report the bug as accurately and detailed as possible.

Setting volume on the volume column (xx) at the same time with Rxy resets the volume to xx before each re-trigger making the effect sound different.

Tips
Use R8y instead of R0y when you want to keep the volume unchanged, these two x values are often documented inaccurately as "No volume change" and "Unused", respectively.

Txy Tremor
Syntax:	T
x + 1 = ticks on
y + 1 = ticks off
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· T13
··· ·· ·· T00
··· ·· ·· T31
··· ·· ·· T00
Explanation:
Rapidly alters note volume from full to zero, x + 1 and y + 1 setting the duration of the states in ticks.

Notes:
Using T00 makes a fast tremor effect but it also functions as effect memory repeating the last parameters. So you can only use this 00 speed once per channel before you use any other parameter values.

X1x Extra fine portamento up
Syntax:	X1
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· X11
··· ·· ·· X10
··· ·· ·· X18
··· ·· ·· X10
Explanation:
Works just like E1x fine portamento up, only with 4 times the precision.

X2x Extra fine portamento down
Syntax:	X2
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· X11
··· ·· ·· X20
··· ·· ·· X28
··· ·· ·· X20
Explanation:
Works just like E2x fine portamento down, only with 4 times the precision like E1x extra fine portamento up.

xx Set note volume
Syntax:	xx = volume
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· 10 ···
··· ·· 40 ···
··· ·· 00 ···
Explanation:
Sets the note volume 00 – 40 overriding sample volume setting. This is what the volume column is primarily used for, hence no effect command character. It's the equivalent of Cxx set note volume on the effect column.

+x Volume slide up
Syntax:	+
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 10 ···
··· ·· +2 ···
··· ·· +4 ···
··· ·· +8 ···
Explanation:
Slides note volume up at speed x with the song speed (ticks) acting as a multiplier like with Ax0 volume slide on the effect column.

-x Volume slide down
Syntax:	-
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· -2 ···
··· ·· -4 ···
··· ·· -8 ···
Explanation:
Slides note volume down at speed x with the song speed (ticks) acting as a multiplier like with A0y volume slide on the effect column.

Dx Fine volume slide down (displayed as ▼x)
Syntax:	D
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ▼2 ···
··· ·· ▼4 ···
··· ·· ▼8 ···
Explanation:
This is the volume column equivalent of EBx fine volume slide down, effect is applied once per row.

Lx Panning slide left (displayed as ◀x)
Syntax:	L
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ◀2 ···
··· ·· ◀4 ···
··· ·· ◀8 ···
Explanation:
Slides note panning left at speed x with the song speed value (ticks) acting as a multiplier like with P0x volume slide on the effect column.

Mx Portamento to note
Syntax:	M
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
E-4 01 ·· 304
··· ·· M0 ···
··· ·· M1 ···
Explanation:
This is the volume column equivalent of 3xx portamento, only with 1 digit resolution. M1 corresponds to 311, M2 to 322 and so on…

Tips:
3xx and Mx share effect memory, so it's possible to initialize a portamento with a more precise 3xx value and sustain it with M0 freeing the effect column for arpeggios, note delays, tremolo or whatever.

Px Set note panning position
Syntax:	P
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 P4 ···
··· ·· ·· ···
··· ·· PC ···
··· ·· ·· ···
Explanation:
This is the volume column equivalent of 8xx panning, only with 1 digit resolution. P8 corresponds to 888, P9 to 899 and so on…

Tips:
3xx and Mx share effect memory, so it's possible to initialize a portamento with a more precise 3xx value and sustain it with M0 freeing the effect column for arpeggios, note delays, tremolo or whatever.

Rx Panning slide right (displayed as ▶x)
Syntax:	R
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· ···
··· ·· ▶2 ···
··· ·· ▶4 ···
··· ·· ▶8 ···
Explanation:
Slides note panning right at speed x with the song speed value (ticks) acting as a multiplier like with Px0 volume slide on the effect column.

Sx Set vibrato speed
Syntax:	S
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 48F
··· ·· S4 A01
··· ·· ·· 600
··· ·· ·· 400
Explanation:
Sets the vibrato speed like the x in 4xy vibrato. In the example it is used instead of 4xy to free up the effect column.

Ux Fine volume slide up (displayed as ▲x)
Syntax:	U
x = speed
Example:
C-4 ·1 10 ···
··· ·· ▲2 ···
··· ·· ▲4 ···
··· ·· ▲8 ···
Explanation:
This is the volume column equivalent of EAx fine volume slide up, effect is applied once per row.

Vx Vibrato
Syntax:	V
x = depth
Example:
C-4 ·1 ·· 484
··· ·· V0 ···
··· ·· V8 ···
··· ·· V0 ···
Explanation:
Performs vibrato with depth x but requires the speed component to be initialized with 4x0 or Sx.

Notes:
Note pitch isn't reset when the command is discontinued.

7. MIDI support
MilkyTracker supports basic MIDI input, which means you can use your MIDI device to feed notes into MilkyTracker. Enabling MIDI input varies a little from platform to platform - here's how to do it on…

Windows:	Select Preferences from the system menu (top left corner of the window)
OSX:	Select Preferences from the MilkyTracker menu or press Command-,
Linux:	Enabled by default if available on the system. See the Linux readme for details.
8. Known issues and bug reports
MilkyTracker aims for full Fasttracker II compatibility in its replay but this goal is easier set than achieved. Some of the original effect implementations defy all documentation and logic. Here's a list of current replay differences between FT2 and Milky:

E3x glissando control is not implemented.
E4x vibrato control is not implemented.
E7x tremolo control is not implemamented.
Handling of E6x pattern loop and EEx pattern delay on the same row
Portamento overflow "effect" isn't reproduced in MilkyTracker.
Volume column effects used in conjunction with EDx note delay
If you find more incompatibilities, or if MilkyTracker crashes or does something really stupid, we'd really like to hear from you and it would be even cooler if you could describe how to reproduce the problem. There's a section dedicated to bug reports on our web forum.
