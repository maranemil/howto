The CC BY-NC license, also known as Attribution-NonCommercial, allows others to use, adapt, remix, and distribute a work for non-commercial purposes, provided they give credit to the original creator. This means that while the work can be shared and built upon, it cannot be used for any purpose that generates a commercial profit. 
Here's a breakdown:

Attribution (BY):
This is a mandatory part of the license. Users must give appropriate credit to the original creator, provide a link to the license, and indicate if any changes were made. 

Non-Commercial (NC):
This clause restricts the use of the work to non-commercial purposes. This means the work cannot be used for any activity that generates a profit or monetary compensation. 

For example, a CC BY-NC licensed image could be used on a personal blog or a non-profit website, but not in a commercial advertisement or a for-profit publication. The specific details of what constitutes "commercial" can sometimes be complex, but the general principle is that if money is changing hands or the use is directly related to profit generation, it's likely to be considered commercial.
