Here is an example of a Python program that shuffles frames from two videos and outputs the result as a new video. This example uses the opencv-python library for video processing.
Code:
Pythonimport cv2
import numpy as np

def shuffle_videos(video1_path, video2_path, output_path, fps=30):
    # Open the two video files
    cap1 = cv2.VideoCapture(video1_path)
    cap2 = cv2.VideoCapture(video2_path)

    # Get video properties
    width = int(cap1.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
    height = int(cap1.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
    fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')  # Codec for output video

    # Ensure both videos have the same resolution
    if (width != int(cap2.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH)) or
        height != int(cap2.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))):
        print("Error: Videos must have the same resolution.")
        cap1.release()
        cap2.release()
        return

    # Create a VideoWriter object for the output video
    out = cv2.VideoWriter(output_path, fourcc, fps, (width, height))

    while True:
        # Read frames from both videos
        ret1, frame1 = cap1.read()
        ret2, frame2 = cap2.read()

        # Stop if either video ends
        if not ret1 and not ret2:
            break

        # Shuffle frames: alternate between frames from video1 and video2
        if ret1:
            out.write(frame1)
        if ret2:
            out.write(frame2)

    # Release resources
    cap1.release()
    cap2.release()
    out.release()
    print(f"Shuffled video saved to {output_path}")

# Example usage
video1 = "video1.mp4"  # Path to the first video
video2 = "video2.mp4"  # Path to the second video
output = "shuffled_output.mp4"  # Path to save the shuffled video

shuffle_videos(video1, video2, output)

Explanation:

Input Videos: The program takes two video files as input.
Frame Shuffling: Frames from the two videos are alternated in the output video.
Resolution Check: Ensures both videos have the same resolution to avoid errors.
Output Video: The shuffled video is saved as an MP4 file.

Requirements:
Install OpenCV using:
Bashpip install opencv-python

Example:
If video1.mp4 and video2.mp4 are two input videos, the program will create a new video shuffled_output.mp4 with frames alternated between the two inputs.
