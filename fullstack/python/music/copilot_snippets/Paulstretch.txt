Here is an example of using the pydub library in Python to implement a basic audio time-stretching effect (Paulstretch-like). While pydub itself does not natively support advanced Paulstretch algorithms, it can be used for basic audio manipulation. For more advanced Paulstretch effects, you can use libraries like audiostretchy or AudioFlex.
Below is a Python example using pydub for basic audio stretching:
Code Example:
Pythonfrom pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.playback import play

def stretch_audio(input_file, output_file, stretch_factor):
    """
    Stretches an audio file by a given factor without changing its pitch.
    
    Parameters:
        input_file (str): Path to the input audio file.
        output_file (str): Path to save the stretched audio file.
        stretch_factor (float): Factor by which to stretch the audio (e.g., 2.0 doubles the duration).
    """
    try:
        # Load the audio file
        audio = AudioSegment.from_file(input_file)
        
        # Calculate the new frame rate
        new_frame_rate = int(audio.frame_rate / stretch_factor)
        
        # Apply the new frame rate to stretch the audio
        stretched_audio = audio._spawn(audio.raw_data, overrides={"frame_rate": new_frame_rate})
        
        # Set the frame rate back to the original for playback compatibility
        stretched_audio = stretched_audio.set_frame_rate(audio.frame_rate)
        
        # Export the stretched audio to a file
        stretched_audio.export(output_file, format="wav")
        print(f"Stretched audio saved to: {output_file}")
        
        # Optionally, play the stretched audio
        play(stretched_audio)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

# Example usage
input_audio = "input.wav"  # Replace with your input audio file path
output_audio = "stretched_output.wav"
stretch_factor = 2.0  # Stretch the audio to 2x its original duration

stretch_audio(input_audio, output_audio, stretch_factor)

Explanation:

Stretching Logic: The frame_rate of the audio is adjusted to stretch or compress the duration. A lower frame rate increases the duration, while a higher frame rate decreases it.
Pitch Preservation: The set_frame_rate method ensures the pitch remains unchanged after stretching.
Playback: The play function from pydub.playback allows you to listen to the stretched audio.

Requirements:
Install pydub and ffmpeg:
Bashpip install pydub

Ensure ffmpeg is installed and available in your system's PATH.
Notes:
For true Paulstretch effects (extreme time-stretching with smooth transitions), consider using specialized libraries like audiostretchy or AudioFlex. Let me know if you'd like an example using those libraries!
