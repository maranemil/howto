This tutorial demonstrates how to generate images of handwritten digits using a [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) (DCGAN). The code is written using the [Keras Sequential API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) with a `tf.GradientTape` training loop.

## What are GANs?
[Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) (GANs) are one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A *generator* ("the artist") learns to create images that look real, while a *discriminator* ("the art critic") learns to tell real images apart from fakes.

![A diagram of a generator and discriminator](./images/gan1.png)

During training, the *generator* progressively becomes better at creating images that look real, while the *discriminator* becomes better at telling them apart. The process reaches equilibrium when the *discriminator* can no longer distinguish real images from fakes.

![A second diagram of a generator and discriminator](./images/gan2.png)

This notebook demonstrates this process on the MNIST dataset. The following animation shows a series of images produced by the *generator* as it was trained for 50 epochs. The images begin as random noise, and increasingly resemble hand written digits over time.

To learn more about GANs, we recommend MIT's [Intro to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) course.

### The Generator

The generator uses `tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose` (upsampling) layers to produce an image from a seed (random noise). Start with a `Dense` layer that takes this seed as input, then upsample several times until you reach the desired image size of 28x28x1. Notice the `tf.keras.layers.LeakyReLU` activation for each layer, except the output layer which uses tanh.
