Duplication in Unrelated Classes - Georges Golomingi Koni-Nâ€™Sapu

Proposed Refactorings: Proposing a solution for this situation is the most difficult
one. If you have duplicated code in two unrelated classes, consider extracting a class
from one class and then use the new component. If the method really belongs only
in one of the classes, the other class should invoke it. You have to decide where the
method makes sense and ensure it is there and nowhere else.
