The above regular expression says:

    1st Capturing group (^[\r\n]*|[\r\n]+)
        1st Alternative: ^[\r\n]*
        ^ assert position at start of the string
[\r\n]* match a single character present in the list below

                \r matches a carriage return (ASCII 13)
                \n matches a fine-feed (newline) character (ASCII 10)
        2nd Alternative: [\r\n]+
[\r\n]+ match a single character present in the list below
