Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE): IDEs like Qt Creator or
Code::Blocks provide a more integrated environment for coding, debugging,
and managing projects. Qt Creator, in particular, is praised for its user-friendly
interface and powerful debugging tools.
Using Code Editors with C++ Extensions: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular
choice among developers for its extensive plugin ecosystem and cross-platform support.
It offers robust C++ support through extensions like the official C/C++ extension,
which provides features such as syntax highlighting, code navigation, and debugging.
Using Build Systems: Tools like Make, CMake, or SCons are commonly used for managing
the build process. SCons, for example, is recommended for its ease of use and handling
of dependencies and dynamic libraries.

Each method has its advantages, and the best choice depends on your specific needs
and preferences. For beginners, using an IDE like Qt Creator might be the easiest way to start,
while experienced developers might prefer the flexibility of text editors or the power
of build systems.
