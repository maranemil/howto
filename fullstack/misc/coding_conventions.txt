((What Are Coding Rules and Guidelines?))

Coding rules and guidelines ensure that software is:

Safe: It can be used without causing harm.
Secure: It can’t be hacked.
Reliable: It functions as it should, every time.
Testable: It can be tested at the code level.
Maintainable: It can be maintained, even as your codebase grows.
Portable: It works the same in every environment.

((Why Coding Standards Are Important))

The reason why coding standards are important is because they help to ensure safety, security, and reliability.
Every development team should use one. Even the most experienced developer could introduce a coding defect — without realizing it. And that one defect could lead to a minor glitch. Or worse, a serious security breach.
There are four key benefits of using coding standards:

1. Compliance with industry standards (e.g., ISO).
2. Consistent code quality — no matter who writes the code.
3. Software security from the start.
4. Reduced development costs and accelerated time to market.
